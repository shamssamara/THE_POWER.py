THE_POWER.py is a lightweight, interactive Python tool that automates web directory enumeration using Gobuster.
It prompts the user before execution and allows flexible customization of target paths, ensuring safe and controlled usage during assessments.
The tool is designed with a real penetration testing mindset, focusing on accuracy, simplicity, and user control rather than blind automation.
